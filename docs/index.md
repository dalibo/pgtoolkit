pgtoolkit is a Python library providing API to interact with various PostgreSQL
file formats. Namely:

- `pg_hba.conf`
- `.pgpass`

# pip install pgtoolkit
```

GitHub](https://github.com/dalibo/pgtoolkit/issues/new)!


## Project name

There is a homonym project by @grayhemp since September 2013:
[PgToolkit](https://github.com/grayhemp/pgtoolkit). `grayhemp/PgToolkit` is a
single tool projet, thus *toolkit* is misleading. Also, as of June 2018,
`grayhemp/PgToolkit` is inactive for 3 years.

There is no Python library named `pgtoolkit`. There is no CLI program named
`pgtoolkit`. There is no `pgtoolkit` package. Considering this, `pgtoolkit` was
chosen for this project.
